A limited amount of water quality data was collected during several days in late October and early November 1971, and bottom sediment oxygen demand characteristics were investigated during August through November 1972. A limited amount of information related to bacterial and algal characteristics of the upper waterway were also gathered. These data were collected to evaluate the relationship between oxygen demand and available DO resources within the waterway.
